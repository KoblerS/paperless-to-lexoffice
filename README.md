# paperless-to-lexoffice

A synchronization tool that allows you to automatically sync selected documents from **paperless-ngx** into **lexoffice**.  
The sync is **unidirectional** (paperless-ngx ‚ûù lexoffice).

---

## üöÄ Features
- Sync documents from paperless-ngx to lexoffice automatically.  
- Tag-based workflow:  
  - Documents in the **inbox tag** are monitored.  
  - Adding the **lexoffice tag** triggers synchronization.  
- Runs in Docker for easy setup.  

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Before running this service, prepare the following:

- A running **paperless-ngx** instance.  
- A **paperless-ngx API token** (the user must have the rights to view documents and edit tags).  
- A **lexoffice API token** (Public API usage is included in all lexoffice plans ‚úÖ).  
- Two tags in paperless-ngx:  
  - **Inbox Tag** ‚Üí marks incoming documents.  
  - **Lexoffice Tag** ‚Üí marks documents that should be synced.
